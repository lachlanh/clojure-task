## Lachlan Hespe

A Clojure library to turn numbers into a english language string 99 -> 'ninety nine'

## Technical Decisions

- Keep the code simple and readable.
- Take an iterative approach to solving the problem. Tests preceeded most of the code with an approach of just enough to get something working. Some of the tests are now redundant, but show the progression through the code. (also see the commit history for more detail)
- Follow consistent clojure style as much as possible, used [https://guide.clojure.style].

## Notes

- Maybe some more examples of natural language numbers. I used 3007002 as a test and had to think a bit whether "three million _and_ seven thousand and two" may be correct, decided it wasn't :).
- I feel that there are more functional approaches to solving the problem, I got a bit stuck with the need to know the positional state to infix the spaces and joining words, I am keen to get feedback on a more idiomatic functional approach.

## Build

Commands listed here require having lein/clojure/java installed and accessible on the path.
;; TODO LH maybe include a docker file for building/testing.

```bash
lein jar
```

## Test

```bash
lein test
```

### Coverage

```bash
lein cloverage
```
